    "Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose\n",
    "you have collected data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam\n",
    "scores. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The Pearson correlation coefficient, often denoted as \"r,\" is a statistical measure that quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "r = 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "r = -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship.\n",

    "\n",
    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, you would typically use a statistical software or programming language like Python or R. Here, I'll provide a general interpretation of the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is close to 1, it suggests a strong positive linear relationship. In this context, it would mean that as students spend more time studying, their final exam scores tend to be higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "If r is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative linear relationship. This would imply that as students spend more time studying, their final exam scores tend to be lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "If r is close to 0, it suggests little to no linear relationship. In this case, the amount of time spent studying does not have a significant linear impact on final exam scores. However, it's important to note that non-linear relationships may still exist, and other factors might be influencing the exam scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that correlation does not imply causation. Even if a strong correlation is found between study time and exam scores, it does not necessarily mean that studying more causes higher scores. Other variables or factors may be at play, and further analysis or experiments would be needed to establish causation."
